The mpchc platform allows you to connect a Media Player Classic Home Cinema (MPC-HC) or MPC-BE to Home Assistant. It will allow you to see the current playing item, control playback and respond to changes in the playerâ€™s state.

For this component to function, you will need to enable the Web Interface in the MPC-HC options dialog.

HACS has to be installed on your Home Assistant instance.

**Installation**
Copy the `custom_components` content to your home assistant `/config/custom_components/` folder

Then to add MPC-HC to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: mpchc
    host: http://192.168.0.123
```

Configuration variables:
- host (Required): The host name or address of the device that is running MPC-HC.
- port (Optional): The port number. Defaults to 13579.
- name (Optional): The name of the device used in the frontend.

Restart Home Assistant and you should have your new component available. MPC-HC has to be running of course
