# Home Assistant integration for MPC-HC and MPC-BE
This integration was in the past integrated into Home Assistant core then abandonned. I have updated it to make it work with new releases and added new functionalities

The mpchc platform allows you to connect a Media Player Classic Home Cinema (MPC-HC) or MPC-BE to Home Assistant. It will allow you to see the current playing item, control playback and respond to changes in the playerâ€™s state.

For this component to function, you will need to enable the Web Interface in the MPC-HC options dialog.

HACS has to be installed on your Home Assistant instance.

## Features to be considered in the future
- ~~Add remote entity for additional commands~~ [done]
- ~~Migrate code to asyncio~~ [done]
- Media browsing
- ~~Add config flow to avoid manual configuration inside `configuration.yaml`~~ [done]


## Installation

Copy the `custom_components` content to your home assistant `/config/custom_components/` folder.

Beware that the existing custom_components folder in Home Assistant could contain other integrations. You just have to copy the `mpchc` subfolder into the `custom_components` folder so that it sits next to the other components.


## Configuration through setup flow
Go into Integrations > Add an integration, and select MPC-HC

Then configure :
- Name of your MPC-HC instance that will be displayed in Home Assistant
- Host of the MPC-HC (ip or hostname)
- Port (if not changed else let default port)


## Configuration from config file (not recommended)
Then to add MPC-HC to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: mpchc
    host: http://192.168.0.123
```

Configuration variables:
- host (Required): The host name or address of the device that is running MPC-HC.
- port (Optional): The port number. Defaults to 13579.
- name (Optional): The name of the device used in the frontend.

Restart Home Assistant and you should have your new component available. MPC-HC has to be running of course
